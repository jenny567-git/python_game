#------------------------------------------------------
#This module contains all graphics-classes for the cannon game.
#The two primary classes have these responsibilities:
#  * GameGraphics is responsible for the main window
#  * Each PlayerGraphics is responsible for the graphics of a 
#    single player (score, cannon, projectile)
#In addition there are two UI-classes that have no 
#counterparts in the model:
#  * Button
#  * InputDialog
#------------------------------------------------------

# This is the only place where graphics should be imported!
from graphics import *

# TODO: There needs to be a class called GameGraphics here. 
# Its constructor should take only a Game object.
# TODO: The class only needs two methods, sync() and getWindow(). 
# HINT: The constructor needs to create a window, a couple of graphic components and two 
#       PlayerGraphics-objects that in turn create additional components
# HINT: sync() needs to call sync() for the two PlayerGraphics-objects
# HINT: These lines are good for creating a window:
#       win = GraphWin("Cannon game" , 640, 480, autoflush=False)
#       win.setCoords(-110, -10, 110, 155)
# HINT: Don't forget to call draw() on every component you create, otherwise they will not be visible

# TODO: There needs to be a class called PlayerGraphics here.
# TODO: It needs only a constructor and a sync()-method
# HINT: Each PlayerGraphics should contain one Player object. 
# HINT: Should draw a cannon and a scoreboard immediately 
#       (the Player object knows its position)
# HINT: Typically doesn't draw a projectile when created, but creates one at some point
#       when sync() is called.
# HINT: sync() needs to update the score text and draw/update a circle for the projectile if there is one.
